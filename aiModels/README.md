## **Key Functionalities**

### **1. Predictive SLA Monitoring**
- **Model**: `models/predictive_sla_model.py`
- **Purpose**: Predict SLA violations and alert users or engineers proactively.

### **2. Dynamic Task Scheduling**
- **Model**: `models/dynamic_scheduler.py`
- **Purpose**: AI-driven scheduling to assign tasks optimally based on engineer availability, location, and expertise.

### **3. Engineer Recommendations**
- **Model**: `models/engineer_recommendations.py`
- **Purpose**: Matches tasks with the best-suited engineers based on skill, location, and hourly rates.

### **4. Text Analysis**
- **Model**: `models/nlp_model.py`
- **Purpose**: Analyses task descriptions and feedback using natural language processing.

### **5. Real-Time Notifications**
- **File**: `api/engineer_notification.py`
- **Purpose**: Notify engineers about tasks in real time via WebSocket and REST endpoints.

## **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-repo>/notfall-engineers.git
cd notfall-engineers/aiModel
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**
Ensure Python 3.8 or above is installed. Install all required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3. Environment Variables**
Create a `.env` file in the root folder to configure sensitive credentials:
```plaintext
# Example .env file
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./tasks.db
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.mailgun.org
EMAIL_USERNAME=postmaster@example.mailgun.org
EMAIL_PASSWORD=super_secure_password
```

### **4. Run the API Server**
Start the FastAPI server:
```bash
uvicorn api.api_server:app --reload
```

### **5. Test the API**
Visit the API documentation at:
- Swagger: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
